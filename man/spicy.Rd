\arguments{
\item{cells}{A SummarizedExperiment or data frame that contains at least the  variables
x and y, giving the location coordinates of each cell, and cellType.}

\item{condition}{A character specifying which column which contains the condition or `Surv` objects.}

\item{subject}{Vector of subject IDs corresponding to each image if cells is
a data frame.}

\item{covariates}{Vector of covariate names that should be included in the
mixed effects model as fixed effects.}

\item{imageID}{The name of the imageID column if using a SingleCellExperiment or SpatialExperiment.}

\item{cellType}{The name of the cellType column if using a SingleCellExperiment or SpatialExperiment.}

\item{spatialCoords}{The names of the spatialCoords column if using a SingleCellExperiment.}

\item{Rs}{A vector of the radii that the measures of association should be calculated over.}

\item{sigma}{A numeric variable used for scaling when fitting inhomogenous L-curves.}

\item{from}{vector of cell types which you would like to compare to the to vector.}

\item{to}{vector of cell types which you would like to compare to the from vector.}

\item{alternateResult}{A pairwise association statistic between each combination of celltypes in
each image.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing or a BiocParallel MulticoreParam or SerialParam object.}

\item{minLambda}{Minimum value density for scaling when fitting inhomogeneous L-curves.}

\item{weights}{logical indicating whether to include weights based on cell counts.}

\item{weightsByPair}{logical indicating whether weights should be calculated for each cell type
pair.}

\item{weightFactor}{numeric that controls the convexity of the weight function.}

\item{window}{Should the window around the regions be 'square', 'convex' or 'concave'.}

\item{window.length}{A tuning parameter for controlling the level of concavity when estimating concave windows.}

\item{edgeCorrect}{A logical indicating whether to perform edge correction.}

\item{includeZeroCells}{A logical indicating whether to include cells with zero counts in the pairwise association calculation.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to output messages.}

\item{...}{Other options}
